# Generalised Annotation Model

This project is a common effort of the SFL standardisation committee 
to create a common open data model to represent SFL text annotations and parses, 
as well as system networks and other relevant constructs. 


For discussions, requirements and the evolving document specifications of the model(s) please refer to the Wiki Pages of the project.
